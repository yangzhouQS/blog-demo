# Contributing to Riot.js

If youâ€™d like to contribute a feature or bug fix, you can [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) Riot or one of its [submodules](https://github.com/riot), commit your changes, & [send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
Please make sure to [search the issue tracker](https://github.com/riot/riot/issues) first.

### Development Process

`main` is considered safe and should be identical to the last release tag. When submitting pull requests please use the `dev` branch.

### Create a test

Create a test for your specific contribution and submit it with your pull request to ensure the future stability of Riotjs

### Run the tests

Before any pull request please run the following command from your terminal to be sure your changes will not break Riotjs:

```shell
$ make riot
```

### Reporting New Issues

We use [Github Issues](https://github.com/riot/riot/issues) as the Riot.js bug tracker. The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. jsFiddle, jsBin, and other sites provide a way to give live examples.

- [Bug Report Template](http://riot.js.org/examples/plunker/?app=bug-reporter) on plnkr (preferred)
- [Bug Report Template](https://codesandbox.io/s/riotjs-6-bug-template-4umx9?file=/index.html) on codesandbox
